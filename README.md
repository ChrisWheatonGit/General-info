# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects & Mastery Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab — a living repository of hands-on projects, technical research, threat detection use cases, and defensive/offensive simulations. This space is dedicated to developing and demonstrating practical, real-world cybersecurity skills through structured, well-documented work.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves two goals:

1. **Personal Project Hub**  
   A growing collection of self-directed, real-world cybersecurity projects focused on defensive (Blue Team), offensive (Red Team), automation, incident response, malware analysis, and security operations.

2. **Cybersecurity Mastery Framework**  
   Part of a 1-year intensive self-training program designed to prepare for high-level roles such as:
   - Cybersecurity Analyst  
   - SOC Analyst    
   - Security Engineer
   - Ethical Hacker
   - Securtity Architect
   - Chief Security Officer

It includes certification roadmaps, technical labs, tool mastery, frameworks, and reference materials.
